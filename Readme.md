## Description

Bike store Database contains the sales data of a regional Bike brand, which has its presence in multiple cities across US. As a part of this analysis, I conducted a deep down analysis on the database to find sales trends and other insights which will help the company take proactive decisions to increase their overall sales numbers and market share.

The dashboard created gives an overall glimpse of how the company is performing overall and in different cities, along with some trends to help in their decision making process.
